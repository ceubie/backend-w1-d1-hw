## Objective: The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.

## Task 1: Grocery Store Math - Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic


bread = 4.20
peanut_butter = 45
premium_jelly = 1000000000000

print(bread + peanut_butter + premium_jelly)



###
print("=" * 50)

# Task 2: Bank Interest (Extra Credit) If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.


savings = premium_jelly
interest = 1.07
year_end_balance = savings * interest

print(year_end_balance)
