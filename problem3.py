## Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

## Task 1: Code Correction - Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable and then use the type() function to print it out:

# variable_a = "Hello, World!"
# variable_b = 23
# variable_c = 3.14
# variable_d = True


variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True

print(type(variable_a))
print(type(variable_b))
print(type(variable_c))
print(type(variable_d))
